        <div class="panel" id="panel7">
          <div id="txt-godsat">God sat up straight in his throne, his eyes wide, and just as His mouth opened up a bit to speak, everything exploded.</div>
        </div>






        <div class="panel">The earth and sun exploded, and the atoms exploded, and even the elementary particles exploded as all the ribbons of energy unwound and went sailing at the speed of light in all directions. And God exploded.</div>

        <div class="panel">But God can’t explode.</div>

        <div class="panel">And so, it turned out that God wasn’t God at all. He was just a god. (three images here, maybe use old female god image, explosion in her stomach, zoom out, zoom out, then you see how tiny the firs twas compared ot her in the next panel)</div>

        <div class="panel">The real God had just set off a big bang. S/He was about to create everything. It was the beginning again.</div>

        <div class="panel">How could the first god have not seen God, or known that S/He existed? Well, it turns out that just as the first god made humans a little lower than the angels, and the angels a lot lower than himself, god was also a lot smaller than something…God.(recycle image, all tiny compared to flashing light, how to make gif of light sources, light through leaves, etc.)</div>

        <div class="panel">God, when He exploded all the energy ribbons in the universe, did not really notice the first god…picture a child building a sand castle on top of an anthill. An infinite sandcastle.(what is this line trying to say? is it good?)</div>

        <div class="panel">So, this was the true beginning. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.</div>

        <div class="panel">S/He tore out an eyeball and called it the sun. S/He spat at the sun, and the spittle spun in circles around it, and every time it came back to Them God called it a year. After seven years, God sat down on his throne to look at what S/He had made.</div>

        <div class="panel">“It is good,” S/He said.</div>

        <div class="panel">“Eh. It's alright.” Someone Else said.</div>

        <div class="panel">God couldn’t hear the Someone Else, because s/he and all their new creation was inside a giant glass ball the size of a hundred thousand solar systems. Except that, of course, the glass ball wasn’t made of glass, and wasn’t in the shape of a ball. It was a far more complex shape that didn’t exist. (demonstrate varieties of impossible glass balls, old drawings, illusions)</div>

        <div class="panel">“It’s not bad,” Someone Else concluded. “But I’ve seen better.”</div>

        <div class="panel">It turned out that God -who was actually just another, slightly bigger, but still pretty small, god- and everything he had ever made was inside of a big glass ball that wasn’t a glass ball. And that glass ball sat on the shelf of God.</div>

        <div class="panel">God stood up, a little bored with this, the newest of an infinite number of creations. God saw everything. He even saw the creation and destruction of the first god, though he didn’t pay much attention since the second god was covering it up, being slightly bigger than the first god.</div>

        <div class="panel">The second god was slightly bigger than the first god from the real God’s perspective. But of course, he was infinitely bigger from his own perspective, when compared to the first god.</div>

        <div class="panel">God yawned, and went out in the night to oversee his creation.</div>

        <div class="panel">The beginning had long since past. He had created everything many eons ago, and when it all turned out pretty well, he created other creators inside of snow-globes and crystal balls. They didn’t know that He was watching, and He rarely interfered with them.</div>

        <div class="panel">This recent creation had put Him in the mood to take another look at his own creations. He hadn’t inspected his original Earth in many years.</div>

        <div class="panel">For the sake of argument, we can say that God flew over to Earth, and walked on the ground, looking at all the things. Of course, in reality, God no more flew than a whisper flies, or walked than an idea scurries, and it was all more of a mixture of ancient magic and vibrations. But for the sake of argument, and imagery, God walked.</div>

        <div class="panel">He landed in a meadow, near a grove of trees. It was dusk. There were no humans around, but if they had been, He would have been invisible regardless. God, in his perfect wisdom, knew this before He landed…and He had known that He would come to be here, and in such a time and such a way, since the beginning. And before the beginning He had also known, because He, Himself, had never began in the first place.</div>

        <div class="panel">God knew every atom in this clearing like the back of his hand. Not only did He remember making them, they were him, just as much as his hand itself was. The bark of the trees, the clouds of the sky, the clover on the ground…all Him.</div>

        <div class="panel">With His mind on such things, God bent down and ran his hand through the clover…with the same sensation of running it through his hair.</div>

        <div class="panel">He ran it back and forth for a while, enjoying the feeling, and thinking.</div>

        <div class="panel">Then his hand hit on something strange.</div>

        <div class="panel">God’s fingers closed on something new. He plucked it out…</div>

        <div class="panel">…it was a four leaf clover.</div>

        <div class="panel">It felt like his hand was asleep, holding this something else in between his thumb and index finger. God knew everything He had done, would do, and was doing, and they were each the same thing.</div>

        <div class="panel">But He hadn’t done this.</div>

        <div class="panel">He hadn’t put this here. Not only was there not meant to be a four leaf clover here, at this time, but there was not meant to be one with this make-up of DNA, anywhere, ever.</div>

        <div class="panel">God threw the clover down, but even laying among its brethren it burned like a beacon in his mind, real in a different reality than anything else.</div>

        <div class="panel">god threw his hood over his head, and fled, far away and into the darkest corners of space and time, forever looking over his shoulder for Whatever Else was out there.</div>
